=> nvm source string already in /root/.bashrc
=> bash_completion source string already in /root/.bashrc
./install.sh: line 467: /root/.nvm/nvm.sh: No such file or directory
=> Close and reopen your terminal to start using nvm or run the following to use it now:

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
